    "Data visualization is an art and a science. Beyond what we might consider to be the aesthetic aspects of a graph, there are real ways in which humans interpret visuals that play a role in how the image is perceived. We are much better at comparing lengths of objects, for example, than we are at comparing angles or areas. This is one reason that a bar graph is typically a better choice than the much-maligned pie chart. We'll focus in this section on the mechanics of creating charts, but it is important to also think about the design aspects. I recommend picking up a copy of Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic's [Storytelling with Data](https://storytellingwithdata.com).\n",

    "1. Consider the message that you are trying to deliver, and the level of understanding in your audience. If your audience is highly technical, a high level of detail may be appropriate and technical jargon may be easily understood. When conveying information to a less technical audience, you may need to streamline the message to avoid confusion.\n",
    "2. Sketch out (prototype) your plot before starting to build the plot on the computer. Conceptualizing a design can sometimes be more challenging than writing the code.\n",
    "3. Try to remove or minimize any elements that distract from the data.\n",
    "3. Seek out candid and constructive feedback on your designs.\n",
    "4. Think critically about other data visualizations that you observe in literature or presentations. You don't need to share your unsolicited feedback, but mindfully observe what works and what doesn't. Use this to improve your visualizations. If you need some [sometimes amusing] examples of what not to do, check out [WTF Visualizations](https://vis.wtf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why create a plot using Python code, when it's so easy to do in a spreadsheet? Customization and automation! By writing code that creates the plot, I find it easier to customize the look and match styles between graphics that I am using in a presentation or report. Additionally, you can use the `numpy` and `pandas` data structures that we've already introduced to populate the data in a plot. Then, if the data changes, or you need to duplicate the plot with a new dataset, you can just re-run the code and have a matching image.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many people choose to use an alternate to the default `matplotlib` color scheme. There are several options built-in to the package that you can easily select by name with the `plt.style.use` function. Two styles that I particularly like are the `ggplot` style which is patterned after the popular `ggplot` (grammar of graphics) plotting library in the R language, and the `seaborn` style with is patterned after the default style in the Python `seaborn` package that we will introduce in the next unit. Both of these styles have a light gray background, with white major gridlines that both provide a reference for the reader, while not competing for attention with the data that is being shown.\n",

    "Now that we have demonstrated the ability to create common plots in `matplotlib`, how do we save them for use in a presentation or report? We have the ability using the `savefig` functiotn to easily save these plots to a file using the png, pdf or svg file formats.\n",

    "- **png**: A *portable network graphics* (png) file is a bitmap image format that is easily imported into office documents, or used on the web. You will need to set the image size and resolution, in \"dots per inch\" (dpi), to scale the image to larger or smaller displays. The file size will increase as you increase either of these variables. \n",
    "- **pdf**: You are probably familiar with the common pdf format from documents, but this can be used for images as well. A pdf image is stored in a vector format. The technical details are not important, but with a vector format you don't need to worry about an image getting fuzzy as you increase the size. This can be a good choice for publication graphics, but also has compatibility issues with current versions of some office software.\n",
    "- **svg**: The *standardized vector graphics* (svg) file is an xml-based file format that can be used for web graphics. Image files are stored as plain text, and can be edited in a graphics editor like [Inkscape]().\n",

    "- **pdf**\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll notice that I have added another function before saving the files. The function `tight_layout` will render the plot to fit the plot axes to the file, to eliminate whitespace. Alternatively, you can set the layout to *tight* using the `bbox_inches` (bounding box inches) parameter in the `savefig` function."
