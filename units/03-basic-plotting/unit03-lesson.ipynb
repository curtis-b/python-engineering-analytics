When well executed, visualizations can also be a powerful aid in communicating results to others. To illustrate the importance of data visualization, take a look at the output of the example below (don't worry about the code for now). Is the pattern in the data more apparent in the numerical table, or in the scatter plot?"

    "Data visualization is an art and a science. Beyond what we might consider to be the aesthetic aspects of a graph, there are real ways in which humans interpret visuals that play a role in how the image is perceived. We are much better at comparing lengths of objects, for example, than we are at comparing angles or areas. This is one reason that a bar graph is typically a better choice than the much-maligned pie chart. We'll focus in this section on the mechanics of creating charts, but it is equally important to consider the design aspects. To help you learn to increase the impact of your visuals, I recommend picking up a copy of Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic's excellent [Storytelling with Data](https://storytellingwithdata.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "A few tips that will improve your data visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider the message that you are trying to deliver, and the level of understanding in your audience. If your audience is highly technical, a high level of detail may be appropriate and technical jargon may be easily understood. When conveying information to a less technical audience, you may need to streamline the message to avoid confusion.\n",
    "2. Sketch out (prototype) your plot on paper before starting to create the visual on the computer. Conceptualizing a design can sometimes be more challenging than writing the code.\n",
    "3. Try to remove or minimize any elements that distract from the data and the story you are trying to tell.\n",
    "3. Seek out candid and constructive feedback on your designs.\n",
    "4. Think critically about other data visualizations that you observe in literature or presentations. You don't need to share your unsolicited feedback, but mindfully observe what works and what doesn't. Use this to improve your visualizations. If you need some [sometimes amusing] examples of what not to do, do an internet search for \"WTF Visualizations\" and check out the image results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can understand the importance of a good visual, but why create a plot using Python code when it's so easy to do in a spreadsheet? Customization and automation! By writing code to create a plot, I find it easier to customize the look and match styles between graphics that I am using in a presentation or report. Additionally, you can use the `numpy` and `pandas` data structures that we've already introduced to populate the data. Then, if the data changes, or you need to duplicate the plot with a new dataset, you can just re-run the code and have a matching image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After completing this unit, you should be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand basic design principles for data visualization, and where to learn more\n",
    "- Create basic plots using numerical data (line, scatter, bar) using a `numpy` or `pandas` dataset\n",
    "- Customize plot elements including axis labels, tick marks, legend, color scheme\n",

This can be a good choice for publication graphics, but also has compatibility issues with current versions of some office software.\n",
