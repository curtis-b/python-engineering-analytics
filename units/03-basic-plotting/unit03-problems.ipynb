    "The [American Chemistry Council (ACC)](https://www.americanchemistry.com/chemistry-in-america/data-industry-statistics/statistics-on-the-plastic-resins-industry) tracks the annual production of polymers in the United States. Some of the basic industry statistics are made publicly available for download. The file `polymer_production.csv` contains information from the [PIPS Resin Sales and Production CY Figures, 2021 v 2020](https://www.americanchemistry.com/content/download/10906/file/ACC-PIPS-Resin-Sales-and-Production-CY-Figures-2021vs2020.pdf) report, giving 2021 production of thermoplastics in millions of pounds. Visualize this data, highlighting the top 3 polymers produced in 2021. To make the units more globally-relevent, plot the data in metric kilotons (1 kt = 2.2 million pounds).\n",

    "Retail food packages are commonly made by welding plastic films under pressure, at temperatures above their melting point. To test the welding behavior of different polymers, *heat seal curve* is generated, which measures the force required to separate the weld as a function of increasing temperature. For many materials, there is some critical temperature where the failure mode shifts from a peelable seal to a *destruct* seal (where the film fails catastrophically). If you have struggled to open a package that was *supposed* to be peelable, you have experienced this phenomena first hand.\n",
