    "When conducting laboratory measurements, it is common practice to build a calibration curve by measuring the output of the lab instrument with standard samples. In the case of gas chromatography, this is required to determine the *response factor* for a specific chemical in the sensor. The file `gc_calibration.csv` contains calibration data for the measurement of hydrocarbons in polymer samples. The `Concentration` column represents the actual concentration of the hydrocarbon in ppm (mg hydrocarbon / kg polymer). The `FID_Signal` represents the corresponding area measured from the flame ionization detector (FID) signal.\n",

    "Molten polymers typically behave as *pseudoplastic* or *shear-thinning*, non-Newtonian, fluids. This means that their viscosity is not constant, but depends on the shear rate that they are subjected to. For certain ranges of shear rates, the viscosity of a polymer melt may be reasonably described by the Power Law model, which states that: \n",
