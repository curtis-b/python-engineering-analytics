    "# Unit 7: Advanced Data Visualization\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unit 3, we explored how the `matplotlib` package can be used to create, customize and save professional-looking data visualizations. By using Python code to plot our data, we can easily generate plots that have a consistent look for presentations and reports. Additionally, by drawing on other Python packages, such as `pandas`, we can chain together data analysis and plotting steps to create an automated pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this base, we will introduce two additional plotting topics in this unit. First, we will explain the process for creating faceted plots (where data is split between multiple axes in the same figure). The can be helpful to avoid overcrowding the data into a single plot, or to present data that shares one axis scale, but not the second. For instance, we may have multiple variables in time series data that have different $y$ scales. By plotting these on separate, one above the other, we can share the time ($x$) scale, while providing separate y-tick labels. We'll see an example of this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we'll explore the power of the `seaborn` package. This project was built on top of `matplotlib`, and reduces the amount of code that you need to write. This package is specifically designed to streamline the use of data stored in a `pandas.DataFrame`, and will help you out by automatically labeling the $x$ and $y$ axes with the column name and allowing you to easily use a categorical variable to create multiple labeled series in your plot. There won't be as much theory or as many steps in this section - the goal is to provide examples of what is possible in `seaborn`. \n",

    "**After completing this unit, you should be able to:**\n",

    "## 7.1. Creating faceted plots\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unit 4, we created an example where we plotted a time-series data set, and it's derivative. Let's dissect this code to understand how the subplots were created. The key difference, compared to what we have done previously, it that we have introduced new parameters for the [`plt.subplots()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure.subplots) function. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Default Value | Possible Values | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|\n",
    "| `nrows` | 1 | integer | number of rows of plots to create |\n",
    "| `ncols` | 1 | integer | number of columns of plots to create |\n",
    "| `sharex` | `False` | `True`, `False`, `'row'`, `'col'` | should each axis share the same x-ticks? |\n",
    "| `sharey` | `False` | `True`, `False`, `'row'`, `'col'` | should each axis share the same y-ticks? |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have created 2 *rows* of plots, with the default value of 1 *column*. Because these share the same time scale, it is appropriate for them to share the same x-tick positions and labels. However, the y-scale for the signal and its derivative are not in the same units, so these are not shared (because the default argument is `False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When `nrows` or `ncols` is greater than 1 the `ax` object becomes an array, instead of a single `axis`. So, to select the specific axis, array indexing is required. By default, when `nrows==ncols==1`, the `plt.subplots()` function collapses the array to a scalar value so that indexing is not required. This is why we have not needed to use array indexing previously. In contrast if both `nrows` *and* `ncols` are greater than 1, then the return `ax` array will be 2-dimensional. When this is true, then the axis will be selected in a $row \\times column$ form, just like other 2-dimensional matrices. For example, the `axis` in the first row and first column would be selected with `ax[0, 0]`. Try changing this plot to display the two signals side-by-side, instead of top and bottom."

    "## 7.2. Plotting using the `seaborn` package\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) package was developed on top of `matplotlib` to provide easy-to-use functions to produce more complicated plots, especially when you there are multiple categories to display on the same plot. Most of the `seaborn` functions are built to integrate with a `pandas.DataFrame` directly, and we can supply the column names, instead of arrays, for the $x$ and $y$ coordinates. I recommend following the link and exploring the gallery to see the different options, and review the code there. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see that `seaborn` allows us to create complex visuals with just a few simple lines of code. But, there is a trade-off. Because of the work that `seaborn` is doing on your behalf, it can sometimes be more complicated to control the fine details of a plot. For exploratory data analysis, this can be a good trade - you will see progress more quickly. When I have a specific visual that I want to automate, I will typically code that in `matplotlib` directly. One challenge that I have with this package is there is some inconsistency in how the different plot types are coded, and what type of object is returned by the function. This makes it harder to guess how to use a new plot type in `seaborn` and means that I'm more likely to need to refer back to the documentation. "

Then, we supply this `DataFrame` to the [`seaborn.scatterplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html) function. Here, we observe one of the inconsistencies in the return values of the `seaborn` plotting function. Whereas the previous `catplot()` returned the `FacetGrid` object, the `scatterplot()` returns a `matplotlib.Axes` object. This can be found by reading the documentation for the function. The good news is that we know how to work with the `matplotlib.Axes` already from Unit 3. "
