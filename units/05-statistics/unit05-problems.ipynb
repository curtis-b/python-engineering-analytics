Use this data to compare the dart impact energy of BOPP and BOPET films. Plot the histograms, and test the data to determine if there is there is statistical evidence that these two film chemistries have a different impact strength. Assume that the data for each film type is sampled from the normal distribution, but the variance for each film type may not be the same."
