    "# Unit 8: Image Analysis Using `skimage`\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of some experiments are captured in image files, which can be processed to yield a quantitative result. Some examples of engineering image analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Counting particle sizes in a photomicrograph\n",
    "- Measuring % corrosion of a surface based on color shift\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these, there may be other instances where it would be helpful to use image processing techniques to pre-process files for machine learning. Pre-processing steps can include exposure compensation and cropping the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several important packages for image processing which will be introduced in this unit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [`scipy.ndimage`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html)\n",
    "2. [*scikit-image* (`skimage`)](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**After completing this unit, you should be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load an image file into memory\n",
    "- Crop and display the image file\n",
    "- Create a histogram of brightness and/or the individual color channels\n",
    "- Apply a threshold to convert an image to black/white\n",
    "- Count objects in an image\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1. Loading and viewing images\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1.1. Creating an `ndarray` from an image\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many file formats that have been developed to efficiently store images, such as *.png*, *.jpg* and *.gif*. How exactly the image is stored and compressed and stored on the disk is not important, as long as we can extract the data out and work with the individual pixels. The package [*scikit-image* (`skimage`)](https://scikit-image.org/) provides this functionality to convert different image files into matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, import the subpackage `skimage.io`. Call the [`io.imread()`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.io.html#skimage.io.imread) function to load the file and convert it to an `np.ndarray` object. Once the file is loaded, it makes no difference what the original file type was. The returned `np.ndarray` may be in one of 3 forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $M \\times N$ (2d array): Used for grayscale images.\n",
    "2. $M \\times N \\times 3$ (3d array): Used for RGB (red, green, blue) channels in a color image.\n",
    "3. $M \\times N \\times 4$ (3d array): Used for RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha) channels in a color image. The alpha channel provides the opacity value for the pixel. An alpha value of 0 means that the pixel is fully transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For color images, 8 bits per channel will typically be used. The color intensity is represented as an `unsigned byte` data type, which includes integers from $\\left[0,255\\right]$. When the `as_gray=True` parameter is set, a color image will be converted to grayscale. In this case the values in the `np.ndarray` will be floating point values from $\\left[0.0,1.0\\right]$, where 0 is black and 1 is white.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the image now loaded as an `np.ndarray`, we can access the `ndarray.shape` property to see which of the above formats the image has taken. This image, of a prairie chicken that I photographed in central Wisconsin, has loaded as an RGB color image, with a height (rows) of 800 pixels and a width (columns) of 1200 pixels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `matplotlib` package provides the [`Axes.imshow()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.imshow.html) function to display image arrays. Notice that the $\\left( 0,0 \\right)$ point is in the top left of the image. You can uncomment the `Axes.set_axis_off()` function to remove the frame and ticks from the image display."

    "\n",
    "There are many possible applications of image analysis in engineering. The primary technique that will be explored in this unit is counting (and measuring) discrete particles in an image. For instance, maybe there is a need to estimate a particle size distribution based on a calibrated photomicrograph. Or, we can use this technique to count and measure defects in an extruded polymer film. The basic steps that we will apply to identify objects will be the same for both of these problems.\n",

    "*scikit-image* provides a set of example images in the [`skimage.data`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/index.html#data) subpackage that we can use to test algorithms. For this example, we'll use a deep-space image from the Hubble telescope. This image can be loaded by calling the function `data.hubble_deep_field()`, as shown in the example below. Follow the link to find other sample images that you can experiment with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2.1. Converting the color image to grayscale\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we're not concerned with what color the objects are - only that they are much brighter than their surroundings. It will be convenient to convert the sample image to grayscale, versus dealing with each color channel. The `data.hubble_deep_field()` function returns an color image with a shape of $M \\times N \\times 3$. Checking the `ndarray.max()` of the original image shows that the values in the color channel range from $\\left[0,255\\right]$, meaning that this image is 8-bit per channel. The `skimage.color` package provides a function `color.rgb2gray()` which will take the original RGB image and convert it to a grayscale array of shape $M \\times N$. The grayscale array is stored as floating point values $\\left[0,1\\right]$, with 0=black and 1=white.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the use of the `cmap` parameter in the `axis.imshow()` function that displays the grayscale image. The series of numbers $\\left[0,1\\right]$ stored in this array can be mapped to any color scale that we choose. Here, we have selected the colormap `gray`, which maps the minimum value of the array to black and the maximum value of the array to white. The *matplotlib* package contains many alternate colormaps that may be useful for different applications, and the web documentation has a [colormap reference](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html) that may be useful. In the code below, experiment with some of the different colormaps from the documentation by changing the value of the `cmap` argument. The colormap names are case-sensitive, so match the value exactly. Additionally, you can add `_r` at the end of the colormap name to reverse the mapping."

Using our knowledge of the `DataFrame`, these could be filtered out of the data frame using the `area` attribute.

This function takes the image and a minimum pixel count as arguments, and returns the cleaned image.
