    "## 2.1. The `numpy` package for processing numerical data\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unit 1 we discussed the Python ecosystem, including the fact that there are many add-on packages that extend the basic functionality of Python. One fundamental package for engineering analysis is [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/). Specifically, this package defines an object called the `ndarray` (n-dimensional array), which is used for vector and matrix calculations. As we'll see, this data structure looks similar to the list object that we learned previously but it is far superior for data analysis. The `numpy` package also includes a number of functions for creating, loading, modifying and saving data in the `ndarray` object. The functions in this package are written in C/C++, and take advantage of CPU parallelism to offer high performance (computing speed). Luckily, you don't need to know how this works to benefit from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `numpy` package, you will add the following `import` line to your code. Note that we are renaming (or, if you prefer, creating an alias for) the `numpy` package as `np` in this instruction. You will commonly find this type of shorthand used, to cut down on clutter later in the program. Now, when we want to reference `numpy`, we'll instead type `np`. The popular Python packages have a standard abbreviation that you will see referenced in literature. Technically, you could create any alias (using our variable naming rules): `curts_favorite_package`, `package1`, `a`, ... but you'll find that `np` is always used for `numpy` in the literature.\n",

    "### 2.1.1. Creating a 1-dimensional `ndarray`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways that we can create an array of values from scratch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Passing a Python list containing the values\n",
    "2. Generating a sequence (range) of values (useful for plotting, or evaluating a function at different points)\n",
    "3. Generating $n$ values evenly distributed between a start and end point (useful for plotting, or evaluating a function at different points)\n",
    "4. Generating $n$ random values\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of each of these is provided in the code below. Using a Python list is pretty straightforward: simply pass the list (or a variable name that references a list) to the `np.array(list)` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"array range\" or `np.arange(start, stop, step)` allows us to generate an array as an arithmetic sequence. We define the start, stop and step values as parameters in the function. The start value will be the first element in the array. The step value is the number by which we count to generate the sequence (this can be real positive or negative number). The sequence will continue **up to, but not including** the stop value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two related functions, `np.linspace(start, stop, n)` and `np.logspace(start, stop, n)`, that allow us to generate $n$ elements between a start and stop value. Unlike the `np.arange`, both the start and stop values **are included** in the array. As the names implies, `np.linspace` will distribute the values linearly and `np.logspace` will distribute values logarithmically. When using `np.logspace` the start and top are provided in terms of the power of 10, forming a range [$10^{start}, 10^{stop}$]. This can be helpful when evaluating a function that will be plotted on a log scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use the `np.random` module to generate random numbers. This module contains a function (`np.random.random(n)`) that generates a 1 $\\times$ $n$ array of random numbers from a flat interval [0, 1). If you need to sample from other probability distributions, or generate random integers, there are other functions available in [`np.random`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html) that you can look up and use."
