    "# Unit 1: Introduction to Python for Engineering Data Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "As engineers we work with data on a daily basis. You are probably familiar with analyzing data in spreadsheets, statistical software packages and the applications that run equipment or laboratory instruments. Each of these has strengths, so why learn another tool for processing data? \n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever:\n",
    "- Tried to analyze a dataset that was too large to load as a spreadsheet, and crashed the application?\n",
    "- Struggled to follow the chain of calculations between cells in a spreadsheet that a colleague built?\n",
    "- Given up on creating the data visualization that you sketched in your notebook, because it didn't exist in your office software suite?\n",
    "- Wished you could automate the data visualization (graphing) process so that your graphs looked consistent time after time?\n",
    "- Wanted to try multi-variate regression or deep learning on a data set, but didn't know how to get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "A programming tool like Python or R can help you overcome these challenges. Having spent time working with both languages, I find Python to be the more broadly useful tool so we'll focus there. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level programming language that has been around since about 1991. It is open-source and free to use. For someone just getting started with engineering data analysis in Python, I recommend installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), which contains all of the basic modules that you'll need for this course. A full study of the the Python language or computer programming is not in scope for this course. Our focus here is on the application of simple Python concepts, and well-known Python code libraries, to the field of engineering data analysis. I'll assume that you have a basic familiarity with statistics, regression and plotting data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this introduction is to provide the non-programmer basic skills in navigating the Jupyter Notebook and creating Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After completing this unit, you should be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe reasons to use Python for data analysis\n",
    "- Add markdown and code cells to a Jupyter Notebook using keyboard shortcuts\n",
    "- Code and execute a Python function\n",

    "## 1.1. Engineering data analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Akin to the closely-related term *data science*, *engineering data analytics* is a specialization that cuts across all disciplines of engineering. While *data science* may not be specific to any particular problem type, we use *engineering data analytics* to focus on problem types and data sets that are relevent to the practicing engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this specialization, the College of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin offers a specific master's degree program termed *Engineering Data Analytics*. Topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical data analysis and quality control**<br>\n",
    "Statistic analysis and testing, statistical process control (control charts, etc...).\n",
    "- **Machine learning**<br>\n",
    "Classification and regression, including regularization, kernelized methods, support vector machines and deep learning.\n",
    "- **Data visualization**<br>\n",
    "Plotting data to maximize impact and minimize clutter. \n",
    "- **High-performance computing**<br>\n",
    "Code design for data-heavy and processor-intensive scientific computing, including parallel computing, in C/C++/CUDA. \n",

    "Organization, storage and retrieval of data in SQL databases.\n",

    " This series of lessons is being developed as a project in pursuit of that degree. Because I am obviously most familiar with the UW program, I may reference specific courses that likely have analogs at other academic institutions. We obviously won't cover all elements of a data science or engineering data analytics degree in this short series of units. My focus is to introduce a number of fundamental concepts for data analytics, together with the code to execute the analytics task in the Python programming language. This should allow an engineer to become comfortable using Python for basic data analytics tasks, and to open their eyes to a broader set of resources that are available as problem-solving tools."

    "## 1.2. Working with Python and the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers you these benefits versus spreadsheets for engineering data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control**: You have complete control over how your program analyzes the data, and don't need to fight against autocorrect  features. When you have code that works, you can easily and automatically run the same processing steps on new or updated dataset.\n",
    "- **Power**: Programming tools can handle large datasets more efficiently than a spreadsheet. Some of the modules for data analytics are already multi-core or GPU-accelerated, but you can also extend Python if necessary by developing custom C/C++ code to further improve speed.\n",
    "- **Documentation**: When immersed in a project, it's easy for me to feel like I'll remember the details forever and that don't need to take good notes. It's never true. Being able to document your analysis steps is critically important to ensuring accuracy of the results, allowing for robust peer review, and being able to reuse the code for a project in the future. Within Python, there are a few ways that we can approach documentation, using Jupyter Notebooks (as we are here) and/or code comments. To me, the fact that a code file is organized step-by-step also helps me to retrace my steps. \n",
    "- **User Community**: Python has an active user community comprising academic institutions, individuals and corporations that publish modules that you can download and use. High-performance matrix math, data analysis and statistics and machine learning packages have been built and published for your use. They seemlessly integrate with Python, and many of the most popular are included with the Anaconda Distribution. When you have a new problem that you've solved, you can also start a project to give your work back to the community (if you choose to). \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) format is a great way to get started using Python, and can be useful for exploratory data analysis projects. This format allows you to intersperse blocks of code along with formatted text. You can use the formatted text cells to clearly explain your work and, if you choose, export the entire file: text, code and results as a pdf report to share your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you run Jupyter on your local computer, it creates a local \"server\" that runs the Python interpreter. A window is opened in your default web browser with the user interface. Every time you \"run\" a cell, that cell is interpreted by Python and the results are stored in memory. When you run the next cell, previous results are still available to you. Jupyter can also be set up on a remote server that you can access, again through a web browser. In this arrangement, the Python is not executed on your computer, but on the remove server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook itself is organized into \"cells\". Before you have clicked into any cells (or after you hit the \"escape\" key), you are in **command-mode**. In this mode, you can move, add, run or delete cells. By clicking into a cell, you enter **edit-mode**, where you can change the contents of the text or code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1. Markdown-formatted text\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there is no toolbar in the Jupyter Notebook to change the font, or set a word to **bold**. So, how do data scientists create great looking text in their notebooks? Jupyter Notebooks use the \"markdown\" text format, which is also commonly used for documentation in github repositories. Markdown uses additional characters to tag and modify the text, like a hashtag (`#`) at the start of a line to denote a top-level heading, or double-asterisks (`**`) enclosing a work to make it bold. An introduction can be found at [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). If you really like the markdown format you might check out the note-management app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which was recommended to me by a professor. The raw markdown-coded text is translated into HTML code when the cell is \"run\" (ctrl-enter), and individuals familiar with web design will recognize concepts such as heading levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very cool feature for an engineer is the ability to embed [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)-encoded equations into your notebooks. LaTeX can be overwhelming when you first see it. But, after using it for a while, I would choose this over Microsoft Equation Editor any day. For example, we might want to write the formula for the standard deviation of a sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(x-\\bar{x}\\right)^2}{n-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this code: `$$s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(x-\\bar{x}\\right)^2}{n-1}}$$`. You'll see the code when you enter edit-mode for this cell. The LaTeX equation is identified by enclosing it between the dollar sign (`$`) characters. When the dollar sign is doubled, as in the example, the equation is centered. Words starting with a backslash (`\\`) are LaTeX commands, and the braces (`{}`) group code that that command will act upon. We don't go into more depth on LaTeX formatting here, but it can be useful outside of Jupyter markdown, so I encourage you to seek out more information. Specifically, when we get to the section on plotting using the `matplotlib` library, we'll find that we can incorporate LaTeX-formatted equations in our plot labels and text annotations. You can search the web any find many references to the available LaTeX math symbols, but my favorite reference (which I have printed at my desk) can be downloaded from [https://www.caam.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf].\n",

    "\n",
    "Code cells accept Python programming code, just as you would write in other Python programming environments (Idle, Spyder, ...). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.3. Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook system has a number of keyboard shortcuts that can greatly speed up your work. A complete list of keyboard shortcuts can be accessed by pressing **h** from command-mode. Here are my most-used shortcuts, which I recommend that you commit to memory:\n",
    "\n",

I use these terms more or less interchangeably, but you may find that others use *parameters* to specifically refer to the placeholder in the function call and *arguments* for the data that is passed into that parameter. For our purposes, I don't think that is a necessary distinction. The `sin` function has a parameter for the angle in radians.\n",
    "- **Code**: For the `sin` example we don't see the code that is executed when the function is called, but it obviously needs to exist somewhere. One of the nice features of a function is that we don't need to know exactly how the code is implemented to make full use of it. Additionally, if mathematitians / computer scientists come up with a newer/faster method for estimating the sine, they can update the `math` library without affecting our code.\n",

Then, the function code is written below, indented in by either 4 spaces or a tab. The `return` keyword indicates that the result of that line of code will be sent back out of the function. Again, naming of the function, parameters, and any variables used in the code is entirely up to the programmer.
